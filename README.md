# About 
The DESY plugin was created in Fall 2023 as an MVP for a startup founded in an on campus startup incubator. I am the sole developer on the founding team, co-founding with two designers. We hope to expand this MVP to create a web-based platform that brings a multitude of resources to both designers and developers that use DESY.
